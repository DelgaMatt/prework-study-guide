# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## Description

This project was created in order to provide easy access to consolidated information regarding HTML, CSS, Git and Javascript (how to utilize commands associated with each topic and how to incorporate them into code). I was motivated to create this project because alot of the information that's needed to understand coding is provided through several different resources. Many of these resources went further into depth than needed by a budding developer in the beginning of their career or wasnt related enough to adjacent topics. This solved the problem of shuffling through tabs and lists of webpages and articles to find a single command or bit of instruction. I learned how to code through the process and what sort of information might be needed for someone embarking on a similar journey of web development. This includes basic HTML, CSS, Git, and Javascript as well as git workflows, how to find information, how to understand what your code is doing, debugging and when to ask for help.
