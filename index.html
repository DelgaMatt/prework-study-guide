          <li>A Number variable is just a number. No quotes</li>
          <li>A Boolean variable is a True/False value. No quotes</li>

          <li>An Object Variable can be anything. Everything in JS in an object and can be stored in a variable</li>
          <li>Control Flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script</li>
          <li>Comments are snippets of tet that can be added along with code. Browser ignore text marked as comments (/*, */)</li>

          <li>A Strict Equality Operator performs a test to see if two values are equal. Returns a Boolean result (===)</li>
          <li>A Not, Does-not-equal Operator returns the logically opposite value of what it preceds. Turns a true into a false. When it is used alongside the Equality operatory,
              the negation operator tests whether two values are not equal (!, !==)</li>
          <li>Conditionals are code structures used to test if an expression returns true or not (if... else)</li>
